# Public Housing and Public Schools

## Summary
- **Topic**: Causal pathways linking subsidized housing (LIHTC) to public school outcomes in Texas.  
- **Method**: Panel VARX model (2004â€“2018, Texas school district data).  
- **Main Findings**:
  1. LIHTC shocks do not immediately alter student composition.  
  2. School budgets decline initially, rebound, then decline again.  
  3. Reading scores deteriorate with a lag, while math remains stable.  
  4. Demographic shocks are absorbed institutionally.  
  5. Only LIHTC shocks generate significant long-term effects on budgets and scores.
