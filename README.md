# Archived Research

This repository contains **discontinued research projects and papers** that are no longer under active development.  
It serves both as a **personal archive** and a **public reference** for anyone interested in these past works.

## Purpose
- Preserve drafts, code, and notes from projects that were not continued.  
- Provide transparency by sharing materials that may still hold reference value.  

## Structure
Each folder corresponds to a single research project:
- `draft.pdf` : main paper draft  
- `code/` : analysis scripts (R)  
- `data/` : sample or processed datasets (sensitive raw data excluded)  
- `README.md` : short project description and reason for archiving  

## Archieved Paper List:
- **Public Housing and Public Schools**
