# Archived Research

This repository serves as an archive of past and discontinued research projects.  
The purpose is twofold:
- **Personal record-keeping**: preserving drafts, code, and notes from projects that are no longer active.  
- **Public reference**: making these materials accessible for transparency and for others who may find them useful.  

## Repository Structure
- `working_papers/` : Drafts or projects that reached the working paper stage but were not published.  
- `archived/` : Fully discontinued projects with no further development planned.  
- Each folder contains:
  - `draft.pdf` or similar document  
  - (optionally) `code/` and `data/` if relevant  
  - `README.md` with a short summary of the project  

## Notes
- These projects are **archived** and are not under active development.  
- Materials are shared "as is" â€” there may be incomplete code or missing data.  
- If you wish to reuse or build upon these ideas, please provide attribution.
